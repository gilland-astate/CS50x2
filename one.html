					# Section One
					Starting out with C++
					---
					## Why C++?
					* We can easily examine many of the items that make a computer tick. Unlike other high-level languages everything is exposed with C++ and nothing is made easy.

					* You will have to manage your resources properly and thus gain skills you wouldn't with other languages and be a better programmer at the end of it.

					## Why Programmers?
					* **Computer** - programmable machine designed to follow instructions
					* **Algorithm** - a precise, step-by-step plan for solving a problem
					* **Program** - instructions expressed in a programming language in computer memory to make it do something
					* **Programmer** - person who writes instructions (programs) to make computer perform a task
					* **Programming Language** - any language designed specifically for use in creating programs

					SO, without programmers, no programs; without programs,  a computer cannot do anything
