					# Section One
					Introduction to Computers and Programming
					---
					### Computer Hardware
					* Central Processing Unit (CPU)
					* Main Memory (RAM)
					* Secondary Memory / Storage (HDD)
					* Input Devices
					* Output Devices
					---
					### Hardware Components
					![](./assets/hardwarecomponents.png)
					---
					### Central Processing Unit (CPU)
					* Control Unit
						* Retrieves and decodes program instructions
						* Coordinates activities of all other parts of computer
					* Arithmetic & Logic Unit
						* Hardware optimized for high-speed numeric calculation
						* Hardware designed for true/false, yes/no decisions
					---
					### Main Memory (RAM)
					* It is *volatile*. Main memory is erased when program terminates or computer is turned off
					* Also called Random Access Memory (RAM)
					* Organized as follows:
						* *bit* - smallest piece of memory. Has values 0 (off, false) or 1 (on, true)
						* *byte* - 8 consecutive bits. Bytes have addresses.
					* *Address* – Each *byte* in memory is identified by a unique number known as an *address*.
					---
					### Memory Addressing
					![](./assets/memoryaddressing.png)  
					In the figure above we can see that the value `149` is stored at address 16 and `72` at address 23.  
					*Notice that addressing begins at index 0 and that it flows from left to right.*
					---
					### Secondary Storage (HDD)
					* *Non-volatile* - data retained when program is not running or computer is turned off
					* Comes in a variety of media:
						* *magnetic* - traditional hard drives that use a moveable mechanical arm to read/write
						* *solid-state* - data stored in chips, no moving parts, flash drives connected via USB
						* *optical* - CD-ROM, DVD
					---
					### Input Devices
					* Devices that send information to the computer from outside
					* Many devices can provide *input*:
						* Keyboard, mouse, touchscreen, scanner, digital camera, microphone, disk drives, CD drives, etc.
					---
					### Output Devices
					* Devices that can receive information from the computer
					* Many devices can function as *output*:
						* Monitor, printers, speakers, disk drives, CD drives, etc.
					---
					### Categories of Software
					* *System software* - programs that manage the computer hardware and the programs that run on them. 
						* Examples: operating systems, utility programs, software development tools
					* *Application software* - programs that provide services to the user.
						* Examples : word processing, games, programs to solve specific problems
					---
					### Why Programmers?
					* **Computer** - programmable machine designed to follow instructions
					* **Algorithm** - a precise, step-by-step plan for solving a problem
					* **Program** - instructions expressed in a programming language in computer memory to make it do something
					---
					### Why Programmers?
					* **Programmer** - person who writes instructions (programs) to make computer perform a task
					* **Programming Language** - any language designed specifically for use in creating programs  
					&nbsp;  
					SO, without programmers, no programs; without programs, a computer cannot do anything.
					---
					### Algorithm
					![](./assets/algo-example.png)  
					*Well-defined steps to solve a problem.*
					---
					### Computer Code
					Computers execute code that is stored in the *computer memory* in a binary form.

					Humans are not skilled at writing or reading a machine language.
					---
					### Levels of Language
					* Low-Level
						* Machine Language
							* Pure binary, but usually expressed as hexadecimal
						* Assembly Language
							* Corresponds more or less 1:1 with machine language (easy conversion)
							* More human-readable (for some definition of more)
					---
					### Levels of Language
					* High-Level
						* C, C++, Python, Java, etc.
							* Designed to look like a human language
							* Must be translated to machine language
					---
					### Why C++?
					* We can easily examine many of the items that make a computer tick. Unlike other high-level languages everything is exposed with C++ and nothing is made easy.

					* You will have to manage your resources properly and thus gain skills you wouldn't with other languages and be a better programmer at the end of it.

					### Assembly Language (Intel x86)
						&lt;main&gt;:
						push   %ebp
						mov    %esp,%ebp
						and    $0xfffffff0,%esp
						sub    $0x10,%esp
						movl   $0x8048718,0x4(%esp)
						movl   $0x804a020,(%esp)
						call   0x8048500 <_ZStlsISt11char_traitsIcEERSt13basic_ostreamIcT_ES5_PKc@plt>
						mov    $0x0,%eax
						leave  
						ret
					---
					### High-Level (C++)
						int main(){
							std::cout << "Hello, World\n";
							return 0;
						}
					---
					### Complete C++ Program
						#include &lt;iostream&gt;
						
						int main(){
							std::cout << "Hello, World!\n";
							return 0;
						}
					Now, let's take a look at each part of this code and examine each part of the syntax.
					---
					### Program Parts
						#include &lt;iostream&gt;
					* This line is called a *preprocessor directive*.
					* It communicates with a phase of the C++ compiler called the *preprocessor*, telling it to include code from a file named "*iostream*", which is a C++ library.
					* The *iostream* library contains code that is used for input and output activities.
					---
					### Program Parts
						int main()
					* This line is called a *function header*.
					* It begins the definition of a function called "main".
					* Every C++ program *must* contain a `main()` function.
						* The main() function tells the computer where to begin executing.
						* Instructions will be executed one at a time, starting with the first line of main.
					---
					### Program Parts
						{

						}
					* The *curly braces* enclose a *block* of code in C++.
					* *block* - a set of related C++ statements that perform an action
					* Every opening curly brace must match with a closing brace.
						* We indent the code between the { and the }.
					---
					### Program Parts
						std::cout << "Hello, World\n";
					* This *statement* sends the words "Hello, World" to the screen.
					* `std::cout` is the name of the *standard output stream*
						* A *stream* is a one-way flow of data from the point of view of the program.
					* << is the *stream insertion operator*, used to place things into a stream.
					---
					### Program Parts
						std::cout << "Hello, World\n";
					* "Hello, World!\n" is a *string literal* 
						* a *string* is just a collection of characters that are treated as a single unit.
					* String *literal*s are always surrounded by double-quotes.
						* *literal* is a value that is typed directly into the source code, in a representation that the programming language recognizes as a value of a recognized type. Literal values must be formatted according to the syntax rules of the language.
					---
					### Escape Characters
						std::cout << "Hello, World\n";
					* We often want to include *control characters* in our *string literals*, but we don't have the ability to type these in directly. C++ allows the use of *escape characters* for this purpose.
						* *escape character* - any character combination beginning with "\", used to represent a character that cannot otherwise be represented in a string literal.
					---
					### Escape Character Examples
						Code     Meaning
						-----------------
						\n      newline (think of the &lt;ENTER&gt; key)
						\t      tab character
						\"      allows a double-quote in a string literal
						\\      allows a backslash in a string literal
						\r      carriage-return (used in Windows line endings: "\r\n")
					---
					### Program Parts
						return 0;
					* This line terminates the program by causing the `main()` function to return the value `0` to the operating system.
						* No code following this line would ever be executed; this means that the `return 0`; line will always be the last line in `main()`.
					* The operating system considers zero to be an indication that the program ran normally.
						* Other values are possible, and we will use them later.
					---
					### Terms for  Program Parts
					* **preprocessor** : compiler component that works on the source code itself. Directives start with # symbol.
					* **library or header** : a file containing C++ code that adds functionality to your program.
					* **statement** : a single logical step expressed in C++ (usually one line) Ends with a semicolon!
					* **stream** : one-way flow of data in a program
					* **literal** : a data value that is hard-coded in a program
					* **string** : a collection of characters treated as a single data value
					* **block** : a collection of related statements surrounded by curly braces
					---
					### High-Level to Executable file
					1. Create file containing the program with a text editor.
					2. Run preprocessor to convert source file directives to source code program statements.  
					3. Run compiler to convert source program into machine instructions.  
					4. Run linker to connect hardware-specific code to machine instructions, producing an executable file.  
					
					* Steps 2–4 are often performed by a single command or button click.
					* Errors detected at any step will prevent execution of following steps.
