					# Section One
					Introduction to Computers and Programming
					---
					### Computer Hardware
					* Central Processing Unit (CPU)
					* Main Memory (RAM)
					* Secondary Memory / Storage (HDD)
					* Input Devices
					* Output Devices
					---
					### Hardware Components
					![](./assets/hardwarecomponents.png)
					---
					### Central Processing Unit (CPU)
					* Control Unit
						* Retrieves and decodes program instructions
						* Coordinates activities of all other parts of computer
					* Arithmetic & Logic Unit
						* Hardware optimized for high-speed numeric calculation
						* Hardware designed for true/false, yes/no decisions
					---
					### Main Memory (RAM)
					* It is *volatile*. Main memory is erased when program terminates or computer is turned off
					* Also called Random Access Memory (RAM)
					* Organized as follows:
						* *bit* - smallest piece of memory. Has values 0 (off, false) or 1 (on, true)
						* *byte* - 8 consecutive bits. Bytes have addresses.
					* *Address* â€“ Each *byte* in memory is identified by a unique number known as an *address*.
					---
					### Memory Addressing
					![](./assets/memoryaddressing.png)  
					In the figure above we can see that the value `149` is stored at address 16 and `72` at address 23.  
					*Notice that addressing begins at index 0 and that it flows from left to right.*
					---
					### Secondary Storage (HDD)
					* *Non-volatile* - data retained when program is not running or computer is turned off
					* Comes in a variety of media:
						* *magnetic* - traditional hard drives that use a moveable mechanical arm to read/write
						* *solid-state* - data stored in chips, no moving parts, flash drives connected via USB
						* *optical* - CD-ROM, DVD
					---
					### Input Devices
					* Devices that send information to the computer from outside
					* Many devices can provide *input*:
						* Keyboard, mouse, touchscreen, scanner, digital camera, microphone, disk drives, CD drives, etc.
					---
					### Output Devices
					* Devices that can receive information from the computer
					* Many devices can function as *output*:
						* Monitor, printers, speakers, disk drives, CD drives, etc.
					---
					### Categories of Software
					* *System software* - programs that manage the computer hardware and the programs that run on them. 
						* Examples: operating systems, utility programs, software development tools
					* *Application software* - programs that provide services to the user.
						* Examples : word processing, games, programs to solve specific problems
					---
					### Why Programmers?
					* **Computer** - programmable machine designed to follow instructions
					* **Algorithm** - a precise, step-by-step plan for solving a problem
					* **Program** - instructions expressed in a programming language in computer memory to make it do something
					---
					### Why Programmers?
					* **Programmer** - person who writes instructions (programs) to make computer perform a task
					* **Programming Language** - any language designed specifically for use in creating programs  
					&nbsp;  
					SO, without programmers, no programs; without programs, a computer cannot do anything.
					---
					### Algorithm
					![](./assets/algo-example.png)  
					*Well-defined steps to solve a problem.*
					---
					### Computer Code
					Computers execute code that is stored in the *computer memory* in a binary form.

						11000111 01000100 00100100 00000100 00011000 10000111 00000100
					
					Humans are not skilled at writing or reading a machine language.
					---
					### Levels of Language
					* Low-Level
						* Machine Language
							* Pure binary, but usually expressed as hexadecimal
						* Assembly Language
							* Corresponds more or less 1:1 with machine language (easy conversion)
							* More human-readable (for some definition of more)
					---
					### Levels of Language
					* High-Level
						* C, C++, Python, Java, etc.
							* Designed to look like a human language
							* Must be translated to machine language
					---
					### Why C++?
					* We can easily examine many of the items that make a computer tick. Unlike other high-level languages everything is exposed with C++ and nothing is made easy.

					* You will have to manage your resources properly and thus gain skills you wouldn't with other languages and be a better programmer at the end of it.

					C, C++, and C# account for over 25% of the popularity in choice of language.

					### Where are they used?
					* Desktop Apps: C#, C++, Python, Java
					* Mobile Apps: Swift, Java, Kotlin, C#
					* Web Apps: Javascript, Python, PHP, Ruby

						11000011

					### Machine Language (Hexadecimal)

						89 e5                  
						83 e4 f0               
						83 ec 10

						b8 00 00 00 00         
						c9                     
						c3
					---
					### Assembly Language (Intel x86)
						&lt;main&gt;:
						push   %ebp
						mov    %esp,%ebp
						and    $0xfffffff0,%esp
						sub    $0x10,%esp
						movl   $0x8048718,0x4(%esp)
						movl   $0x804a020,(%esp)
						call   0x8048500 <_ZStlsISt11char_traitsIcEERSt13basic_ostreamIcT_ES5_PKc@plt>
						mov    $0x0,%eax
						leave  
						ret
					---
					### High-Level (C++)
						int main(){
							std::cout << "Hello, World\n";
							return 0;
						}
					---
					### Programming Paradigms
					* Structured/Procedural Programming
						* Focused on the process of programming. Functions are written to process the tasks given.
					* Object Oriented Programming
						* Focused on creating objects to accomplish the tasks. Data and the functions to work on that data are encapsulated together.  
					C++ is a type of OOP language, but both paradigms can be implemented.
