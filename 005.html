					# Section Five
					Input/Output
					---
					### C++ Streams
					* A *stream* is a one-way flow of information. Output streams flow from the computer outward to the user. Input streams flow from the user to the computer.
					* The standard output stream is `std::cout`, and the standard input stream is `std::cin`.
					* C++ follows Unix thinking when dealing with streams in which all items whether they be file, console, network, etc function in a similar fashion.
					---
					### `cout` Object
					* `cout`(console output) is an object in the `iostream` (input/output stream) library.
					* The object functions as a stream that displays output to the console, which is typically the monitor.
					* We use the *stream insertion operator* (<<) to send output to `cout`.
					* We can chain the insertion operator to display multiple results to the screen.
							std::cout << "Hello" << " World!";
					---
					### `endl` Manipulator
					* `endl` is used to end the line of output when using stream insertion operator. It clears the buffer as well.
					* `endl` has benefits over `\n` in that it clears the buffer before moving onto other lines of code.
						* Since computers are multi-process now the CPU can look at tasks and determine which could be ran parallel
						* If a task crashes before finishing or hangs and you don't have the `endl` manipulator you may not output all of the items to the screen.
					---
					### `cin` Object
					* `cin`(console input) is an object similar to `cout`.
					* The object functions as a stream that inputs from the console, which is typically the keyboard.
					* We can use the *stream extraction operator* (>>) to retrieve output from `cin`.
					* We can chain the extraction operator to pull multiple results from the stream.
							std::cin >> firstName >> lastName;
					---
					### Stream Extraction
					* * The *type* of the variable that is intended to store the data must match the *type* of the data being extracted, otherwise the operation may fail.
					* Input from `cin` is *whitespace delimited*, which means it will continue until it encounters a whitespace character.
						* It will read up-to and including the whitespace character and then discard it.
					* Chaining `cin` reads together with the stream extraction operators means that each additional variable will wait for input until all are filled.
					---
					### Simple Example
						int     temperature;
						double  rainfall;
						cout << "Enter the temperature in degrees Fahrenheit: ";
						cin  >> temperature;
						cout << "Enter the day's rainfall total: ";
						cin  >> rainfall;
					* The code above will read a temperature and rainfall from the user (entered from the keyboard) storing the values in the respective variables.
					* **NOTICE** the necessity of *prompting* the user before reading the values!
					---
					### Streams
					* At this point we have introduced the *standard input stream* and the *standard output stream*, however C++ provides the opportunity to create other streams as well.
						* All input streams support the same operations.
						* All output streams support the same operations.
						* So, if you can use `std::cin` and `std::cout`, you can use any stream!
					---
					### Files
					* *file* - a collection of related data stored on a device other than main memory and accessed by means of a *file name*.
					* *file name* - a string that uniquely identifies a single file on the system.

					In the most basic sense a file, is just a blob of data that we store somewhere and it's name simply refers to the location of that file.
					---
					### Files and Streams
					* We can work with files the same way we work with the standard streams.
					* We first begin by including the `&lt;fstream&gt;` library.
					* We will then open the file in *text mode*, meaning the contents are encoded as plain [ASCII](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/ascii) text.
						* This will "feel" exactly the same as interacting with the standard streams.
					* We can also open files in *binary mode* which we will talk about later.
					---
					### File Operations
					* Working with files will involve a series of high-level steps.
						* Opening the File - This will associate the filename with the physical file and establish a stream to/from the file.
						* Read or write data from/to the file - We do this just like reading/writing to the standard in/out streams.
						* Close the file - This allows use to flush the buffers, and release the resources associated with the file back to the OS.
					---
					### Output File Streams
						#include &lt;fstream&gt;

						double value1 = 4.4, value2 = 3.8;
						std::ofstream fout;
						
						fout.open("myOutFile.txt");
						fout << value1 << std::endl << value2;
						fout.close();
						
					* The code above will write the `value1` and `value2` contents `4.4` and `3.8` respectively out to a file named *myOutFile.txt* in the current directory.
					---
					### Input File Streams
						#include &lt;fstream&gt;

						double value1, value2;
						std::ifstream fin;
						
						fin.open("myInFile.txt");
						fin >> value1 >> value2;
						fin.close();
	
						std::cout << value1 << ", " << value2 << std::endl;
					* The code above will read into `value1` and `value2` the contents of the file *myInFile.txt* and output them to the screen.
					---
					### File I/O Tips & Tricks
					* You can declare the stream and open on the same line.
							std::ofstream fout("myOutFile.txt");
					* A `std::fstream` object can either input or output (or even both), but you must specify the mode when opening.
							std::fstream fs;
							// Open for input
							fs.open("myFile.txt", std::fstream::in); 
							fs.close();
							// Open for output at the end of the file.
							fs.open("myFile.txt", std::fstream::out | 
							                      std::fstream::app);
					---
					### File Open Failures
					* Opening a input file may **fail** if:
						* The file doesn't exist or is misnamed.
						* You do not have permission to read the file.
						* All OS file resources are in use.
					* Opening an output file may **fail** if:
						* The file exists, but you don't have permission to overwrite it.
						* You do not have permission to write to the directory.
						* All OS file resources are in use.
					---
					### Testing for Failures
					* We must always test if our files opened properly, failure to do so can result in a program crash (**bad**).
					* To do so we will use an `if` control structure and the stream function `is_open()`.
							std::ifstream fin("myInputFile.txt");
							if( !fin.is_open() ) {
								std::cout << "Failed to open file." << std::endl;
								exit(1);
							}
					This `if` structure will test if the file is open (`true` if open), and if it's not (`!`), then report to the screen and exit with an error code (`1`);
					---
					### More Stream Manipulators
					* We talked a bit about the `endl` stream manipulator, but now let's talk a bit about the other manipulators to make our output clearer.
					* Control how output displays for numeric, string data:
						* size
						* position
						* number of digits
					* We require the inclusion of the `iomanip` header
					---
					### `std::setw(x)` Manipulator
					* Can be used to setup tables properly for displaying data.
					* Controls the width of **ONLY** the next item in the stream.
					* Prints in a field at least `x` wide. Will print the entirety of the object so make sure your width specified is enough.
					* Does **NOT** truncate to fit in the space specified.
					---
					### `std::left` & `std::right` Manipulators
					* When using `setw(x)` it's often nice to be able to left or right-align the data in the columns.
					* Adding `std::left` will left align **ALL** content in the following stream; Adding `std::right` will right align **ALL** content in the following stream.
					* These will cancel the previous opposing manipulator out. 
							cout << setw(10) << right << "right" 
							     << setw(10) << left << "left";
							     
							     rightleft
					---
					### `std::setprecision(x)` Manipulators
					* Will affect **ALL** following stream operations from the point at which it is set until it is changed.
					* Used to affect the amount of digits shown in a numerical output.
					* When used alone the `x` value will determine the number of significant digits to be displayed.
					---
					### `std::fixed` and `std::showpoint` Manipulators
					* When `std::setprecision(x)` is used along with the `std::fixed` manipulator instead of simply displaying `x` significant digits it will output `x` decimal digits in addition to the entirety of the whole number.
					* `std::showpoint` can be used to force following stream operations to always print the decimal point for floating-point values including those that are represent whole numbers.
