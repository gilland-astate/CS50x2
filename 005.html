					# Section Five
					Input/Output
					---
					### C++ Streams
					* A *stream* is a one-way flow of information. Output streams flow from the computer outward to the user. Input streams flow from the user to the computer.
					* The standard output stream is `std::cout`, and the standard input stream is `std::cin`.
					* C++ follows Unix thinking when dealing with streams in which all items whether they be file, console, network, etc function in a similar fashion.
					---
					### `cout` Object
					* `cout`(console output) is an object in the `iostream` (input/output stream) library.
					* The object functions as a stream that displays output to the console, which is typically the monitor.
					* We use the *stream insertion operator* (<<) to send output to `cout`.
					* We can chain the insertion operator to display multiple results to the screen.
							std::cout << "Hello" << " World!";
					---
					### `endl` Manipulator
					* `endl` is used to end the line of output when using stream insertion operator. It clears the buffer as well.
					* `endl` has benefits over `\n` in that it clears the buffer before moving onto other lines of code.
						* Since computers are multi-process now the CPU can look at tasks and determine which could be ran parallel
						* If a task crashes before finishing or hangs and you don't have the `endl` manipulator you may not output all of the items to the screen.
					---
					### `cin` Object
					* `cin`(console input) is an object similar to `cout`.
					* The object functions as a stream that inputs from the console, which is typically the keyboard.
					* We can use the *stream extraction operator* (>>) to retrieve output from `cin`.
					* We can chain the extraction operator to pull multiple results from the stream.
							std::cin >> firstName >> lastName;
					---
					### Stream Extraction
					* * The *type* of the variable that is intended to store the data must match the *type* of the data being extracted, otherwise the operation may fail.
					* Input from `cin` is *whitespace delimited*, which means it will continue until it encounters a whitespace character.
						* It will read up-to and including the whitespace character and then discard it.
					* Chaining `cin` reads together with the stream extraction operators means that each additional variable will wait for input until all are filled.
					---
					### Simple Example
						int     temperature;
						double  rainfall;
						cout << "Enter the temperature in degrees Fahrenheit: ";
						cin  >> temperature;
						cout << "Enter the day's rainfall total: ";
						cin  >> rainfall;
					* The code above will read a temperature and rainfall from the user (entered from the keyboard) storing the values in the respective variables.
					* **NOTICE** the necessity of *prompting* the user before reading the values!
					---
					### Streams
					* At this point we have introduced the *standard input stream* and the *standard output stream*, however C++ provides the opportunity to create other streams as well.
						* All input streams support the same operations.
						* All output streams support the same operations.
						* So, if you can use `std::cin` and `std::cout`, you can use any stream!
					---
					### Files
					* *file* - a collection of related data stored on a device other than main memory and accessed by means of a *file name*.
					* *file name* - a string that uniquely identifies a single file on the system.

					In the most basic sense a file, is just a blob of data that we store somewhere and it's name simply refers to the location of that file.
					---
					### Files and Streams
					* We can work with files the same way we work with the standard streams.
					* We first begin by including the `&lt;fstream&gt;` library.
					* We will then open the file in *text mode*, meaning the contents are encoded as plain [ASCII](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/ascii) text.
						* This will "feel" exactly the same as interacting with the standard streams.
					* We can also open files in *binary mode* which we will talk about later.
					---
					### File Operations
					* Working with files will involve a series of high-level steps.
						* Opening the File - This will associate the filename with the physical file and establish a stream to/from the file.
						* Read or write data from/to the file - We do this just like reading/writing to the standard in/out streams.
						* Close the file - This allows use to flush the buffers, and release the resources associated with the file back to the OS.
					---
					### Output File Streams
						#include &lt;fstream&gt;

						double value1 = 4.4, value2 = 3.8;
						std::ofstream fout;
						
						fout.open("myOutFile.txt");
						fout << value1 << std::endl << value2;
						fout.close();
						
					* The code above will write the `value1` and `value2` contents `4.4` and `3.8` respectively out to a file named *myOutFile.txt* in the current directory.
					---
					### Input File Streams
						#include &lt;fstream&gt;

						double value1, value2;
						std::ifstream fin;
						
						fin.open("myInFile.txt");
						fin >> value1 >> value2;
						fin.close();
	
						std::cout << value1 << ", " << value2 << std::endl;
					* The code above will read into `value1` and `value2` the contents of the file *myInFile.txt* and output them to the screen.
					---
					### File I/O Tips & Tricks
					* You can declare the stream and open on the same line.
							std::ofstream fout("myOutFile.txt");
					* A `std::fstream` object can either input or output (or even both), but you must specify the mode when opening.
							std::fstream fs;
							// Open for input
							fs.open("myFile.txt", std::fstream::in); 
							fs.close();
							// Open for output at the end of the file.
							fs.open("myFile.txt", std::fstream::out | 
							                      std::fstream::app);
					---
					### File Open Failures
					* Opening a input file may **fail** if:
						* The file doesn't exist or is misnamed.
						* You do not have permission to read the file.
						* All OS file resources are in use.
					* Opening an output file may **fail** if:
						* The file exists, but you don't have permission to overwrite it.
						* You do not have permission to write to the directory.
						* All OS file resources are in use.
					---
					### Testing for Failures
					* We must always test if our files opened properly, failure to do so can result in a program crash (**bad**).
					* To do so we will use an `if` control structure and the stream function `is_open()`.
							std::ifstream fin("myInputFile.txt");
							if( !fin.is_open() ) {
								std::cout << "Failed to open file." << std::endl;
								exit(1);
							}
					This `if` structure will test if the file is open (`true` if open), and if it's not (`!`), then report to the screen and exit with an error code (`1`);
					---
					### More Stream Manipulators
					* We talked a bit about the `endl` stream manipulator, but now let's talk a bit about the other manipulators to make our output clearer.
					* Control how output displays for numeric, string data:
						* size
						* position
						* number of digits
					* We require the inclusion of the `iomanip` header
					---
					### `std::setw(x)` Manipulator
					* Can be used to setup tables properly for displaying data.
					* Controls the width of **ONLY** the next item in the stream.
					* Prints in a field at least `x` wide. Will print the entirety of the object so make sure your width specified is enough.
					* Does **NOT** truncate to fit in the space specified.
					---
					### `std::left` & `std::right` Manipulators
					* When using `setw(x)` it's often nice to be able to left or right-align the data in the columns.
					* Adding `std::left` will left align **ALL** content in the following stream; Adding `std::right` will right align **ALL** content in the following stream.
					* These will cancel the previous opposing manipulator out. 
							cout << setw(10) << right << "right" 
							     << setw(10) << left << "left";
							     
							     rightleft
					---
					### `std::setprecision(x)` Manipulators
					* Will affect **ALL** following stream operations from the point at which it is set until it is changed.
					* Used to affect the amount of digits shown in a numerical output.
					* When used alone the `x` value will determine the number of significant digits to be displayed.
					---
					### `std::fixed` and `std::showpoint` Manipulators
					* When `std::setprecision(x)` is used along with the `std::fixed` manipulator instead of simply displaying `x` significant digits it will output `x` decimal digits in addition to the entirety of the whole number.
					* `std::showpoint` can be used to force following stream operations to always print the decimal point for floating-point values including those that are represent whole numbers.
					---
					### `getline()` Function
					* So far dealing with the stream extraction operator we have only been able to get information in that had individual pieces. We weren't able to read entire strings of information in that had whitspace characters.
					* In the cases in which you need to read information in a string that includes whitespace we can use the `getline()` function.
					* By default the `getline()` function is newline delimited. 
					---
					### `getline()` Usage
					* The syntax for `getline()` is:
							getline( source_stream, destination_string );
					* `source_stream` is a standard input stream for example `std::cin` or a file stream.
					* `destination_string` is a `std::string` where you would like to put the information read in.
						* Information in `destination_string` will be overwritten and discarded.
					---
					### `getline()` 3 Argument Usage
					* `getline()` also has a 3 argument option if you want to change the delimiter you want to read to:
							getline( source_stream, destination_string, 'delim' );
					* The previous arguments are the same as with the 2 argument.
					* The `delim` argument is a single character you wish to function as your delimiter.
						* When using `getline()` the delimiter will be read in and discarded.
					---
					### Mixing `getline()` and `>>`
					* When using stream extraction (>>) the operation leaves the delimiting whitespace in the input stream.
						* This causes a problem if we read with `>>` and then follow-up with `getline()` as it may appear the function didn't read anything in, however a `\n` may have remained after the stream extraction.
					* We may remedy this by using the `ignore()` function.
					---
					### `ignore()` Usage
						std::cin.ignore(std::numeric_limits<std::streamsize>::max(), '\n');
					* The above function will ensure that we ignore/throw away all characters up to and including the next newline character.
					* `ignore()` also has a single arugment form where we can specify the number of characters to ignore and the 2 argument as demonstrated above that accepts a delimiter.
							input_stream.ignore( num_chars );
							input_stream.ignore( num_chars, delim );
					---
					### `get()` Function
					* We have another tool in our belt when parsing input and that is the `get()` function. There are three versions and their syntax is as follows:
							input_stream.get( dest_char );
							input_stream.get( dest_cstring, num_to_read );
							input_stream.get( dest_cstring, num_to_read, delim );
					* `input_stream` is the stream from which you would like to extract from. `dest_char` is a single `char` variable to read into. `dest_cstring` is a C-string to read into. `num_to_read` is the number of `char` to read in. And, `delim` is the delimiter.
					---
					### `get()` Usage
					* When using the 3-argument version get will not read and discard the `delim` so we must do that ourselves with `ignore()`.
					* `get()` is not delimited normally so it will read in whitespace, newline characters, etc.
						* When using the 2-argument option it will not stop at the end of the C-string and will read and move as much as it can up to `n-1` characters.
