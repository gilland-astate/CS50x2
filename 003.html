					# Section Three
					Variables and Special Characters
					---
					### Special Characters
					| Character | Name | Meaning |
					| --- | --- | --- |
					| // | Double slash | Beginning of a comment |
					| # | Pound Sign (Hash) | Beginning of a preprocessor directive |
					| < > | Open/Close brackets | Mainly used to enclose an `#include` |
					---
					### Special Characters
					| Character | Name | Meaning |
					| --- | --- | --- |
					| ( ) | Open/Close parenthesis | Argument passing, function header, etc. |
					| { } | Open/Close braces | Encloses a block of code, sets scope |
					| " " | Open/Close quotation marks | Enclose a string of characters |
					| ; | Semicolon | End of statement |
					---
					### Comments
					* Comments allow us to add non-executing parts to our code to increase readability.
					* Two types of comments
						* `//` - Line level comments, these comments end at the next newline
						* `/* */` - Block level comments, these comments start at the `/*` and end at `*/`  

								int a; // This is a comment
								/* int a; This is all a comment */
					---
					### Variables
					As we have already established, it's pretty hard to remember numbers. So it would be helpful if we had a way of referring to
					memory addresses as a descriptive name. Variables allow us to just this.
					* *variable* - a named storage location for data within a program
					---
					### Variables
					* *variable declaration* - a statement used to tell the compiler that a new variable should be created; contains the identifier and type for the variable.

							int temperature;
							char wind;
					The *declaration statement* above tells the compiler to create a variable named `temperature` that will store an *integer*.
					---
					### Literal
					* *literal* - a value that is written into a programs code
					
							int temperature = 12;
							char wind = 'E';
							double time = 12.5;
					The *literal*s above are the items to the right of the assignment operator.
					---
					### Identifiers
					* *identifier* - a programmer-defined name for some part of the program: function, variable, etc.

							int temperature = 12;
							void setTemperature();
					The *identifiers* above are `temperature` and `setTemperature`.
					---
					### Identifier Naming
					* Names should represent the purpose of the item being named. Thus, `int temperature` should be an integer variable that holds a temperature.
					* The first character of an identifier must be an alphabetic character or an underscore (`_`)
					* After the first, you can use alphabetic, numeric, or underscore characters.
					* Identifiers **must not be** a keyword.
					* Identifiers are case-sensitive. (`temperature` & `Temperature` are different)
					---
					### Data Types
					So, what types of data can we store? The tables below will give a sampling of the major data types you will encounter throughout this class.

					| Type Name | Description | Literal Examples |
					| --- | --- | --- |
					| int | Integer number | 74, -193 |
					| double | Floating point number | 3.14, -0.1 |
					| char | Single character | 'a', '9' |
					---
					### Data Types
					| Type Name | Description | Literal Examples |
					| --- | --- | --- |
					| bool | Boolean value | `true`, `false` |
					| std::string | String value | "Hello", "beepBoop5"

					These are not all of the types you will encounter but are a good look at the main ones.
					---
					### Memory Footprint
					* Each data type has a different memory footprint size.
					* To determine the memory footprint of a data value you can ask C++ by using the `sizeof()` function

							std::cout << sizeof(int);
							> 4
					---
					### Integers
					* `int` is the primary integer type and can range from ~-2B to ~2B and is 4 bytes
					* `long` gives you double the precision but takes 8 bytes
					* `unsigned` allows you to gain precision by dropping the negative numbers but still same memory footprint
					* `short` halves our memory footprint to 2 bytes
					---
					### Integer Literals
					* Integer literals by default are stored as `int`s
					* Integer literals that begin with a `0`(zero) are treated as octal (base 8): `02322` = `1234`
					* Integer literals that begin with `0x` are treated as hexidecimal (base 16): `0x4D2` = `1234`
					---
					### Characters
					* The `char` datatype is primarily used to hold a single character
					* It may also be used to hold very small positive numbers (up to 255)
					* Uses 1 byte of memory
					* The numeric value of the character is stored in memory
