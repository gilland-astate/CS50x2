					# Section Four
					Operators
					---
					### Families of Operators
					* C++ Operators can be divided into families
						* Assignment Operators
						* Arithmetic Operators
						* Stream Operators
						* Relational Operators
						* Logical Operators
						* Other Operators
					---
					### Classes of Operators
					* In C++ we can have 3 different classes of Operators depending upon the number of operands.
						* *unary* - single operand   --   `-5`
						* *binary* - two operands   --   `12 + 8`
						* *ternary* - three operands   --   `exp1 ? exp2 : exp3`
					---
					### Operator Associativity and precedence
					* *operator associativity* - the direction in which an operator evaluates						
					* *operator precedence* - the order in which operators evaluate
							ans = 9 + 5
					The `+` operator associates from left-to-right and the `=` associates from right to right-to-left.
					But, since the `+` has a higher precedence than `=`.

					[Operator Precedence Chart](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/operator_precedence)
					---
					### Assignment Operator
					* One of the first operators most people encounter is the *assignment operator* (`=`). Used to change the value of a variable.
					* It should always be read as "assigned" or "is assigned". It should **never** be read as "equals"!
							int temperature = 82;
							// `temperature` is assigned the value 82.
					* Assignment associativity is from right to left, precedence is low.
					* There are some others but we first need to talk arithmetic!
					---
					### Arithmetic Operators
					* These operators are used for performing numeric calculations.
					* These are all binary operators
					* These operators can be chained and will evaluate and follow typical order of operations you are familiar with in Mathematics
					* Associativity: Left-to-Right, Precedence is mid
					---
					| Operator | Operation | Example | `ans` |
					| --- | --- | --- | --- |
					| `+` | addition | `ans = 9 + 5;` | 14 |
					| `-` | subtraction | `ans = 9 - 5;` | 4 |
					| `*` | multiplication | `ans = 9 * 5;` | 45 |
					| `/` | division | `ans = 9 / 5;` | 1 |
					| `%` | modulus | `ans = 9 % 5;` | 4 |
					---
					### Arithmetic Tips / Tricks
					* Beware the *division operator*! 
						* If both operands are integers the result will be an integer.
						* If either operand is floating point the result will be a floating point as expected.
					* The *modulus operator* (`%`) computes the remainder resulting from integer division
						* `14 % 3` will return `2`
						* `14 % 3.0` will `error`
					---
					### Combined Assignment
					* *Combined assignment operators* provide a shorthand for arithmetic and assignment operations.
							a = a + 12;
					* This is a very easy to understand and very common occurrence in programming. C++ allows us to use combined operators to increase readability and reduce repetition.
					---
					### Combined Assignment
						a += 12;
					* Instead of writing the previous statement we can combine our arithmetic operator with the assignment operator.
					* Combined operators work by both applying the arithmetic operator to the Left and Right operands and then assigning the total back into the Left operand.
					---
					### Combined Assignment
					| Operator | Example Usage | Equivalence |
					| --- | --- | --- |
					| `+=` | `x += 5;` | `x = x + 5;` |
					| `-=` | `x -= 5;` | `x = x - 5;` |
					| `*=` | `x *= 5;` | `x = x * 5;` |
					| `/=` | `x /= 5;` | `x = x / 5;` |
					| `%=` | `x %= 5;` | `x = x % 5;` |
					---
					### Combined Assignment
					* (Assuming x = 10)
					| Operator | Example Usage | `x` after statement |
					| --- | --- | --- |
					| `+=` | `x += 5;` | `15` |
					| `-=` | `x -= 5;` | `5` |
					| `*=` | `x *= 5;` | `50` |
					| `/=` | `x /= 5;` | `2` |
					| `%=` | `x %= 5;` | `0` |
					---
					### Type Conversion and Casting
					* The type of a variable must always match the type of the data you are storing in it.
					* Some type conversion is possible, and some will take place automatically.
					* *explicit conversion* - when you convert a value to a different type by casting
							static_cast&lt;int&gt;(3.14) // Produces the value 3
							static_cast&lt;double&gt;(3) // Produces the value 3.0
					---
					### Type Conversion and Coercion
					* *implicit conversion* - when a value is converted to a different type automatically by the compiler
					* Implicit conversion when storing a more-precise type into a less-precise type can lead to errors.
							double numberOne = 1; // numberOne is storing 1.0
							int numberTwo = 4.75; // numberTwo is storing 4
					* *type coercion* - when an operand is automatically converted to another data type
					---
					### Type Coercion
					* *promotion* - when an operand is coerced to a more-precise data type
					* *demotion* - when an operand is coerced to a less-precise data type
							int a = 2; double b = 5.0;
							a = b; // b will be demoted when assigned to a
							b = a; // a will be promoted when assigned to b
					---
					### Coercion rules
					* When operating on values of different data types, the lower one is promoted to the type of the higher one.
					* When using the *assignment operator* (=), the type of the expression on the right will be converted to the type of variable on the left.
					---
					### Overflow and Underflow
					* *Overflow* and *Underflow* occur when assigning a value that is too large (*overflow*) or too small (*underflow*) to be held in a variable.
					* The variable will contain this value by "wrapping around" to the next value.
					* Different systems may display a warning/error, stop the program, or continue execution using the incorrect value.
					---
					### Stream Operators
					* We have already seen code using the *stream insertion operator* (`&lt;&lt;`) and the *stream extraction operator* (`&gt;&gt;`)
					* The stream operators function as a binary operator with the stream in the left operand and the item to be inserted in the right operand.
					* The associativity of the stream operators is from left-to-right and is slightly lower than arithmetic.
					---
					### Relational and Logical Operators
					* We will cover these in later sections, but for now:
						* *relational operators* - Operators dealing with one value in relation to another (less than, greater than, equal)
						* *logical operators* - Operators dealing with logical patterns (AND, OR, NOT)
