					# Section Seven
					Repetition
					---
					### Repetition
					* So far we have been able to make decisions with our control structures, however what if we wanted to repeat an action until a condition.
					* The ability to perform repetative tasks at great speeds is one of the hallmarks of computing, and one of the major improvements we can achveive with computers.
					---
					### Loops
					* Repeating code is accomplished with the help of control structures called *loops*.
					* C++ provides three *loop* structures (four if you consider the *for each*):
						* `while`
						* `do-while`
						* `for`
					* Each loop has it's own syntax and best-use cases.
					---
					### Terminology
					* **Loop Control Variable** - a variable whose value is tested in order to determine if the *loop* body should execute.
					* **Loop Condition** - a *boolean expression*  whose result determins if the *loop* body should execute, or continue doing so. If it evalutes `true` then the *body* executes.
					---
					### `while` Control Structure
					* The `while` loop is the most basic loop available in C++. It can accomplish the same as all other loops, but may not be the right solution depending on the problem.
					* **SYNTAX**:
							while(conditional) {
								statement_to_repeat;      // body
							} 
					* These are very similar to a basic `if` structure assuming you would like to repeat the statements in the body.
					---
					### Three Steps of Loop Creation
					* **Step 1** - Setup the *Loop Control Variable* (LCV) to the proper state in preperation of the loop.
					* **Step 2** - Create the proper *Loop Condition* for your loop which should test the LCV.
					* **Step 3** - The value of the LCV must be changed within the body of the loop.
						* Failure to execute this step will in turn create an *infinite* loop.
					---
					### Three Steps Example
						int counter = 1;                    // set up LCV
						while ( counter <= 10 ) {           // loop condition
							std::cout << counter << "\t";   // loop body
							counter = counter + 1;          // update LCV
						}


						Output:

						1	2	3	4	5	6	7	8	9	10
					
					---
					### Means of Control Classification
					* **Iterative Loop** - Also known is a count-control loop, these are loops that are controlled by a *counter* variable that counts up one by one.
					* **Event-Controlled Loop** - These loops repeat until a certain condition is met. There are 3 sub-types:
						* **Sentinel-Controlled** - A loop that repeats until a specified data value, *sentinel*, is encounted.
						* **Flag-Controlled** - A loop that repeats until the boolean flag flips to `false`
						* **End-of-File** - a loop that repeats (based on a stream) until the End of File, EOF, marker is read.
					---
					### Means of Timing Classification
					* **Pre-Test Loop** - A loop structure that tests it's condition *before* the loop body is executed.
						* `while`
						* `for`
					* **Post-Test Loop** - A loop structure that test it's condition *after* the loop body is exectured.
						* `do-while`
					---
					### Means of Control Examples
					* Iterative Loop:
							int counter = 10;                   // set up LCV
							while ( counter > 0 ) {             // loop condition
								std::cout << counter << "\t";   // loop body
								counter = counter - 1;          // update LCV
							}
					* Event-Controlled Loop:
							int value = 0;                      // set up LCV
							while( value <= 0 ){                // until LCV is positive
								std::cout << "Enter a positive integer: ";
								std::cin  >> value;             // update the LCV
							}
					* You can easily determine the classification with event-controlled because you cannot look at the loop alone and tell when it ends!
					---
					### `for` Control Structure
					* The `for` loops main use is as an *iterative loop*.
					* **SYNTAX**:
							for(initializer; conditional; update) {
								statement_to_repeat;
							}
					* The *initializer* executes the first time the loop is ran and only the first time. 
					* The `for` loop is a *pre-test* loop therefore it checks the *conditional* each time before running the body.
					* Upon executing the body, the *update* is executed before falling back to check the *conditional*.
