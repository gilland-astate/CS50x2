					# Section Seven
					Repetition
					---
					### Repetition
					* So far we have been able to make decisions with our control structures, however what if we wanted to repeat an action until a condition.
					* The ability to perform repetative tasks at great speeds is one of the hallmarks of computing, and one of the major improvements we can achveive with computers.
					---
					### Loops
					* Repeating code is accomplished with the help of control structures called *loops*.
					* C++ provides three *loop* structures (four if you consider the *for each*):
						* `while`
						* `do-while`
						* `for`
					* Each loop has it's own syntax and best-use cases.
					---
					### Terminology
					* **Loop Control Variable** - a variable whose value is tested in order to determine if the *loop* body should execute.
					* **Loop Condition** - a *boolean expression*  whose result determins if the *loop* body should execute, or continue doing so. If it evalutes `true` then the *body* executes.
					---
					### `while` Control Structure
					* The `while` loop is the most basic loop available in C++. It can accomplish the same as all other loops, but may not be the right solution depending on the problem.
					* **SYNTAX**:
							while(conditional) {
								statement_to_repeat;      // body
							} 
					* These are very similar to a basic `if` structure assuming you would like to repeat the statements in the body.
					---
					### Three Steps of Loop Creation
					* **Step 1** - Setup the *Loop Control Variable* (LCV) to the proper state in preperation of the loop.
					* **Step 2** - Create the proper *Loop Condition* for your loop which should test the LCV.
					* **Step 3** - The value of the LCV must be changed within the body of the loop.
						* Failure to execute this step will in turn create an *infinite* loop.
					---
					### Three Steps Example
						int counter = 1;                    // set up LCV
						while ( counter <= 10 ) {           // loop condition
							std::cout << counter << "\t";   // loop body
							counter = counter + 1;          // update LCV
						}


						Output:

						1	2	3	4	5	6	7	8	9	10
					
					---
					### Means of Control Classification
					* **Iterative Loop** - Also known is a count-control loop, these are loops that are controlled by a *counter* variable that counts up one by one.
					* **Event-Controlled Loop** - These loops repeat until a certain condition is met. There are 3 sub-types:
						* **Sentinel-Controlled** - A loop that repeats until a specified data value, *sentinel*, is encounted.
						* **Flag-Controlled** - A loop that repeats until the boolean flag flips to `false`
						* **End-of-File** - a loop that repeats (based on a stream) until the End of File, EOF, marker is read.
					---
					### Means of Timing Classification
					* **Pre-Test Loop** - A loop structure that tests it's condition *before* the loop body is executed.
						* `while`
						* `for`
					* **Post-Test Loop** - A loop structure that test it's condition *after* the loop body is exectured.
						* `do-while`
					---
					### Means of Control Examples
					* Iterative Loop:
							int counter = 10;                   // set up LCV
							while ( counter > 0 ) {             // loop condition
								std::cout << counter << "\t";   // loop body
								counter = counter - 1;          // update LCV
							}
					* Event-Controlled Loop:
							int value = 0;                      // set up LCV
							while( value <= 0 ){                // until LCV is positive
								std::cout << "Enter a positive integer: ";
								std::cin  >> value;             // update the LCV
							}
					* You can easily determine the classification with event-controlled because you cannot look at the loop alone and tell when it ends!
					---
					### `for` Control Structure
					* The `for` loops main use is as an *iterative loop*.
					* **SYNTAX**:
							for(initializer; conditional; update) {
								statement_to_repeat;
							}
					* The *initializer* executes the first time the loop is ran and only the first time. 
					* The `for` loop is a *pre-test* loop therefore it checks the *conditional* each time before running the body.
					* Upon executing the body, the *update* is executed before falling back to check the *conditional*.
					---
					### `for` Examples
					Example 1 (Iterative)

						for( int counter = 1; counter <= 10; counter += 1 ) {
							std::cout << counter << "\t";
						}
					
					Example 2 (Iterative)

						int counter;
						for( counter = 10; counter > 0; counter -= 1 ) {
							std::cout << counter << "\t";
						}

					Example 3 (Event-Controlled)

						int value;
						for( value = 0; value <= 0; std::cin >> value ){
							std::cout << "Enter a positive integer: ";
						}
					---
					### Range-based `for`
					* C++ 11 added the ability to iterate over all elements of a sequence container using a more consise syntax:
					* **SYNTAX**:
							for(item_declaration : container)
								statement_to_repeat;

							for(item_declaration : container) {
								statement_1;
								[...]
								statement_n;
							}
					---
					### Range-based `for` Example
					* It's important to introduce this here, yet be aware we haven't and won't speak about the containers that are needed for the *foreach* loop. With that said `vector` below is an iterable container that contains values.
							// Create some values in a collection:
							std::vector<int> values{ 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 };
							// Print them to standard output using the 
							// range-based `for`:
							for( int item : values ) {
								std::cout << item << "\n";
							}
					---
					### `do-while` Control Structure
					* The `do-while` loop is the only example of a post-test loop available in C++. Also notice it is the only loop that concludes in a semi-colon.
					* **SYNTAX**: 
							do {
								statement_1;
								[...]
								statement_n;
							} while(loop_conditional);
					---
					### `do-while` Examples
					Example 1 (Iterative)
						
						int counter = 1;                    // set up LCV
						do {                                // loop entry
							std::cout << counter << "\t";   // loop body
							counter = counter + 1;          // update LCV
						} while( counter <= 10 );
					Example 2 (Event-Controlled)
						
						int value;                          // declare LCV
						do {                                // loop entry
							std::cout << "Enter a positive integer: ";
							std::cin  >> value;             // read/update LCV
						} while( value <= 0 );
					*Don't forget the semi-colon!*
					---
					### Structure Choice
					* `while`
						* pre-test loop
						* Well suited for *Event-Controlled Loops*
					* `for`
						* pre-test loop
						* Well suited for *Iterative Loops*
						* Range-based `for` is great for containers
					* `do-while`
						* post-test loop
						* Well suited for *Event-Controlled Loops* used for *validation*
					---
					### Nested Loops
					* Similar to the way we can nest `if` control structures we can also nest loops.
					* One of the best use-cases for nested loops are for displaying/parsing tables (rows/columns)
							int counter = 0;
							for(int row = 0; row < 3; row++) {
								for(int col = 0; col < 3; col++) {
									cout << counter << "\t";
								}
								cout << endl;
							}
							Output:		0	1	2
							               3	4	5
									       6	7	9
