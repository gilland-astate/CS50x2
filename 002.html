					# Section Two
					Introduction to C++
					---
					### Complete C++ Program
						#include &lt;iostream&gt;
						
						int main(){
							std::cout << "Hello, World!\n";
							return 0;
						}
					Now, let's take a look at each part of this code and examine each part of the syntax.
					---
					### Program Parts
						#include &lt;iostream&gt;
					* This line is called a *preprocessor directive*.
					* It communicates with a phase of the C++ compiler called the *preprocessor*, telling it to include code from a file named "*iostream*", which is a C++ library.
					* The *iostream* library contains code that is used for input and output activities.
					---
					### Program Parts
						int main()
					* This line is called a *function header*.
					* It begins the definition of a function called "main".
					* Every C++ program *must* contain a `main()` function.
						* The main() function tells the computer where to begin executing.
						* Instructions will be executed one at a time, starting with the first line of main.
					---
					### Program Parts
						{

						}
					* The *curly braces* enclose a *block* of code in C++.
					* *block* - a set of related C++ statements that perform an action
					* Every opening curly brace must match with a closing brace.
						* We indent the code between the { and the }.
					---
					### Program Parts
						std::cout << "Hello, World\n";
					* This *statement* sends the words "Hello, World" to the screen.
					* `std::cout` is the name of the *standard output stream*
						* A *stream* is a one-way flow of data from the point of view of the program.
					* << is the *stream insertion operator*, used to place things into a stream.
					---
					### Program Parts
						std::cout << "Hello, World\n";
					* "Hello, World!\n" is a *string literal* 
						* a *string* is just a collection of characters that are treated as a single unit.
					* String *literal*s are always surrounded by double-quotes.
						* *literal* is a value that is typed directly into the source code, in a representation that the programming language recognizes as a value of a recognized type. Literal values must be formatted according to the syntax rules of the language.
					---
					### Escape Characters
						std::cout << "Hello, World\n";
					* We often want to include *control characters* in our *string literals*, but we don't have the ability to type these in directly. C++ allows the use of *escape characters* for this purpose.
						* *escape character* - any character combination beginning with "\", used to represent a character that cannot otherwise be represented in a string literal.
					---
					### Escape Character Examples
						Code     Meaning
						-----------------
						\n      newline (think of the &lt;ENTER&gt; key)
						\t      tab character
						\"      allows a double-quote in a string literal
						\\      allows a backslash in a string literal
						\r      carriage-return (used in Windows line endings: "\r\n")
					---
					### Program Parts
						return 0;
					* This line terminates the program by causing the `main()` function to return the value `0` to the operating system.
						* No code following this line would ever be executed; this means that the `return 0`; line will always be the last line in `main()`.
					* The operating system considers zero to be an indication that the program ran normally.
						* Other values are possible, and we will use them later.
					---
					### Terms for  Program Parts
					* **preprocessor** : compiler component that works on the source code itself. Directives start with # symbol.
					* **library or header** : a file containing C++ code that adds functionality to your program.
					* **statement** : a single logical step expressed in C++ (usually one line) Ends with a semicolon!
					* **stream** : one-way flow of data in a program
					* **literal** : a data value that is hard-coded in a program
					* **string** : a collection of characters treated as a single data value
					* **block** : a collection of related statements surrounded by curly braces
					---
					### High-Level to Executable file
					1. Create file containing the program with a text editor.
					2. Run preprocessor to convert source file directives to source code program statements.  
					3. Run compiler to convert source program into machine instructions.  
					4. Run linker to connect hardware-specific code to machine instructions, producing an executable file.  
					
					* Steps 2â€“4 are often performed by a single command or button click.
					* Errors detected at any step will prevent execution of following steps.
					---
					### Compiler Chain
					![](./assets/compilechain.png)
					---
					### Integrated Developer Environments
					* Also commonly referred to as IDEs.
					* Combine all the tools needed to write, compile, and debug a program into a single software application.
					* We will be using the Mimir environment for our IDE.
					* Other examples are Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, Eclipse, Intellij
					---
					### Common Programming Elements
					* Keywords
					* Programmer-Defined Identifiers
					* Operators
					* Punctuation
					* Syntax
					---
					### Algorithm
					![](./assets/algo-example.png)  
					---
					### Translated to C++
						#include &lt;iostream&gt;
						
						int main() {
							double hours, rate, pay;

							std::cout << "How many hours did you work? ";
							std::cin >> hours;

							std::cout << "How much do you get paid per hour? ";
							std::cin >> rate;

							pay = hours * rate;
							std::cout << "You have earned $" << pay << std::endl;
							return 0;
						}
					---
					### Keywords
					* These *keywords* are reserved specifically by the language and may not be used outside of their special meaning.
					* These are like `double`, `using`, `return`
					---
					### Programmer-Defined Identifiers
					* These identifiers are names made up by the programmer.
					* Not part of the C++ language.
					* Used to represent various things: variable names, functions, etc
					* These are like `hours`, `rate`, `pay`
					---
					### Operators
					* These are used to perform actions on data
					* May types of operators
						* Arithmetic: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`
						* Assignment: `=`
					* `=`, `*`, `::`, `>>`, and `<<` are all operators we used earlier
					---
					### Punctuation
					* Characters that mark the end of a statement, or that seperate items in a list.
					* `;` and `,` were used in the previous code.
					---
					### Syntax
					* Syntax is the rules of grammar that must be followed when writing the program.
					* Controls the use of keywords, operators, programmer-defined identifiers, and punctuation.
					---
					### Variables
					* Variables are named storage locations in a computer's memory for holding a piece of data.
					* We specify the variable type, followed by a programmer-defined identifier to create a variable. This is called a variable declaration.
					* Previously we used `double hours, rate, pay;` to define 3 variables of type `double` (double-precision floating point number).
					* A variable in C++ can only hold the type that it is defined to hold.
					---
					### Programming Errors
					We are all human, and thus it happens from time to time (sometimes more often than not....) that we make errors.
					They are unavoidable and learning to expect and deal with them is a key component of learning to program.
					* It's important that we know where and how errors can occur so that we know what and how to fix them.
					---
					### Types of Errors
					* Syntax Errors - occur when you don't follow the syntax of the language, often caught by compiler
					* Semantic Errors - occur when you misuse the language in some way, these are not caught by the compiler
					* Logic Errors - occur when the logic of the program happens, these are avoided by making sure we develop the algorithm correctly
								int number = 3.14; // Syntax Error
								int double number = 5; // Semantic Error
								if( grade > 90 ) { letterGrade = 'F'; } // Logic Error
